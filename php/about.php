                    <p class="bodytext" id="aboutme">Your friendly neighborhood Californian at your service! Born in China, raised mostly in Los Angeles, but I&#39;ve been transplanted to the East Coast for college. I like cats, Sriracha, skiing, Helvetica, and road trips. I dislike Los Angeles traffic (with a passion), public speaking, getting up early, and Comic Sans. In my free time, I can be found trying my hand at various MOBAs, singing show tunes, or watching videos of cute animals, hilarious people, or food being made.
